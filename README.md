# Bike Sales Analysis Project
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bike sales data collected from various sources on the web. The dataset includes information about bike sales in different states of the US, including revenue, sales representatives, store-wise sales, category-wise sales, and more.

# Data Collection and Cleaning
Data was collected from various web sources and imported into Microsoft SQL Server for further analysis.
The data underwent extensive cleaning, including removing null values, standardizing data formats, and resolving inconsistencies.
A clean dataset was created and exported as an Excel file for further analysis.

# Analysis and Visualization
Pivot tables were generated in Excel to classify revenue based on different factors such as state, year, month, store, category, and top customers.
Further analysis was conducted using Tableau to create interactive visualizations for better insights and understanding of the data.
Visualizations include geographical maps, trend analysis, revenue comparison, and more.
